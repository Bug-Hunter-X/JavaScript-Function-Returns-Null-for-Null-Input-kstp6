# JavaScript Function Bug: Unexpected Null Return

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to null handling in functions.

The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers. However, it incorrectly returns `null` if either input is `null`.  This bug is demonstrated in `bug.js`.

A corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrating how to handle null inputs appropriately.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript editor or environment.
3. Run the code using a JavaScript interpreter (e.g., Node.js).

This example highlights the importance of careful null checks in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior.
